<h3 align="center">Falaxir is going to tell you a story</h3>

I was a University student in the Uk and in france. Now a junior software developer.
I use this account to work on my personal projects, it can be simple as developing a website or complex as editing a linux kernel.

### Falarium

I am the founder of Falarium community servers.
I started with a minecraft server way back in 2015 the a Just Cause 3 server in 2017, and now multiple Nanos World server in 2021.
The just cause 3 server is still active, but the community is not active anymore.
